# CryptDict.
A live cryptocurrency 'dictionary' with useful interactive features

An app that features thousands of cryptocurrencies, has organzied and readable live data updated every minute or so.
Features will include:
  Seamless real-time cryptocurrency exchange rates in ALL currencies. (USD, EUR, GBP, RUB, CNY and 100+ other currencies)
  Buyer's Advice, obviously this won't be anything incredibly math intensive or quantitative but just a basic "This is a high price to buy ${cryptoTicker}."
  Numbers changing green and red when updated like a stock exchange.
  Maybe a way to call a graph from the API or find another crypto API that has graphs to call in. (or find a way to code a basic graph on like 50 points)
